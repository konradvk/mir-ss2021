README


To use the software some installation steps have to be performed first: 

1) 	copy all images in the img_db folder

2) 	start the retrieval-server by running the script "retrieval_server.py".
	When the server is running it is available by the portnumber: 4555

3) 	If you use the server the first time or change the used features you have to recalculate
	the index-file. You can do this by clicking the button "recalculate Index" in the gui.




After this is done you can use the system to retrieve images from your data base:

1) 	Afterwards you can choose a picture present in your data base by opening the file chooser 
	via the button "Dateien ausw√§helen"

2) 	Click Upload to display the image on the page.

3) 	Click on retrieve similar to start a query. The results are shown on a separate page.

4) 	You can now refine your query by selecting the images which are most relevant. 
	Selected images are marked with a blue boarder. By clicking an image again you can uncheck them.
	By clickin on "Relevance Feedback!" a new refined query is executed.
