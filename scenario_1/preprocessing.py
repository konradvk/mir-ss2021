def get_images_paths(image_directory, file_extensions):
    """
    Function to receive every path to a file with ending "file_extension" in directory "image_directory".
    Parameters
    ----------
    image_directory : string
        Image directory. For example: 'static/images/database/'
    file_extensions : tuple
        Tuple of strings with the possible file extensions. For example: '(".png", ".jpg")'
    Returns
    -------
    - image_paths : list
        List of image paths (strings).
    Tasks
    -------
        - Iterate over every file_extension
            - Create a string pattern 
            - Use glob to retrieve all possible file paths (https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/glob.html )
            - Add the paths to a list  (extend)
        - Return result

def create_feature_list(image_paths):
    """
    Function to create features for every image in "image_paths".
    Parameters
    ----------
    image_paths : list
        Image paths. List of image paths (strings).
    Returns
    -------
    - result : list of lists.
        List of 'feature_list' for every image. Each image is summarized as list of several features.
    Tasks
    -------
        - Iterate over all image paths
        - Read in the image
        - Extract features with class "feature_extractor"
        - Add features to a list "result"

def write_to_file(feature_list, image_paths, output_path):
    """
    Function to write features into a CSV file.
    Parameters
    ----------
    feature_list : list
        List with extracted features. Should come from 'create_feature_list':
    image_paths : list
        Image paths. List of image paths (strings). Should come from 'get_images_paths':
    output_path : string
        Path to the directory where the index file will be created.
    Tasks
    -------
        - Open file ("output_name")
        - Iterate over all features (image wise)
        - Create a string with all features concerning one image seperated by ","
        - Write the image paths and features in one line in the file [format: image_path,feature_1,feature_2, ..., feature_n]
        - Close file eventually
